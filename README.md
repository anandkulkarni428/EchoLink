</p>

**EchoLink** is an Android app (built with **Jetpack Compose + MVVM**) that lets one device **Host** and other devices **Join** to share and play live audio over Wi-Fi (or hotspot).

Think of it like turning any Android phone into a **wireless Bluetooth-like speaker**, but with multiple receivers supported at once.

## ✨ Features

- 🎵 **Live Audio Streaming**  
  Host captures playback audio (YouTube Music, Spotify, local files) via **MediaProjection + AudioPlaybackCapture**.

- 📲 **Multiple Receivers**  
  Any number of nearby devices can Join a host and play in sync.

- 📡 **Wi-Fi / Hotspot Based**  
  Works without internet, using **UDP multicast + service discovery**.

- 🔔 **Connection Management**  
  Hosts see a Listeners panel with latency (RTT) and per-device toggle.  
  Notifications on new connections. Goodbye messages on disconnect.

- 🎨 **Modern UI**  
  Jetpack Compose + Material 3  
  Role picker (Host / Join)  
  Reactive visualizer

## 🛠 Technical Details

**Architecture**: MVVM (ViewModel, StateFlow, UseCases)  
**UI**: Jetpack Compose, Material 3, custom animations  
**Networking**:
- UDP sockets for low-latency streaming
- NSD (Network Service Discovery) for host discovery
- Simple protocol (HELLO / GOODBYE / PING / PONG)

**Audio Pipeline**:
- Host: `AudioRecord` (AudioPlaybackCaptureConfig) → MediaCodec AAC encoder → UDP packets  
- Receiver: UDP packets → jitter buffer → MediaCodec AAC decoder → AudioTrack  

---

## 📱 Screens

- **Role Picker** → choose Host or Join  
- **Host Screen** → Start/Stop hosting, Listeners panel, notifications  
- **Receiver Screen** → Join host and play audio, animated visualizer  

---

## 🚀 Roadmap / Ideas

- Volume sync across devices  
- Fine-tuned jitter buffer for lower latency  
- LAN discovery without NSD (fallback)  
- Background play + Quick Tile toggle  

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- Requires **Android 10+** (AudioPlaybackCapture API).  
- DRM-protected apps (Netflix, Prime Video, etc.) may block capture.  
- Works best on strong Wi-Fi / hotspot connections.
